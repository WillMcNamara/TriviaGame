# TriviaGame

This is a simple quiz with 5 questions.

I tried to make the code as efficient as possible, but at some points I may have created unneccesary functions that could have just been written in to other functions.

There are still some parts of JQuery that I'm still trying to figure out how to do most efficiently, most notably using the html() function.

The JS code is written so that if you were to add another object to the list of questions array the game should still operate correctly since it will adjust to the new array length.

I tried to mess around with coding a large portion of the html and bootstrap tags inside of the JS file.
